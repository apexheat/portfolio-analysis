## Apex Heat Portfolio Analysis

Our reference model of portfolio analysis result is documented [here](https://github.com/apexheat/portfolio-analysis/blob/main/portfolioAnalysisModel.generated.ts).

The result is a `.csv` file where each row is either of type result or error, so the result file contains columns of both models.
